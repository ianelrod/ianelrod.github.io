Hey you! Remind me to come back and edit this for completeness. Thanks.

My name is Ian Goforth and I'm a self-proclaimed Security Researcher. I graduated from Mississippi State (Go Dawgs!) with a degree in Cyber Security & Operations. In my offtime I like to read, watch anime, take walks, and practice MMA. I'm a Myers-Briggs ENTJ, Enneagram Type 3, and my social security number is... just kidding.

My philosophy is this: life is all about learning. Furthermore, the wise integrate life's lessons in ways the foolish can't or won't. For my entire life I prayed that I could become like that, wise with a dose of self-discipline. I've failed many times. I will continue to fail. But with each failure brings, you know, learning.

In high school I was obsessed with entrepreneurship. I was that kid who probably got made fun of because he thought "making it big" was basically guaranteed. I didn't make it big. My motivation was fleeting and my priorities leaned more towards high-dopamine games like Rocket League and CSGO. I ended up glorifying those who could work on something they didn't enjoy for 2, 4, or even 8 hours at a time. I don't know why I made that my benchmark, but it was a goal that helped me mature. I can't say I had a dramatic comeback; drugs ended up being the answer. Half-way through college I discovered that ADHD was causing a lot of my underlying problems.

I started college as a Computer Science major. But, I disliked coding. I had trouble visualizing coding problems as opposed to, say, a vulnerable box. Something inside me wanted to be able to step away from the problem and view it from the outside, which was hard to do when knee-deep in a complicated program. I switched to Cyber right around the time I started taking ADHD meds. It felt like I had removed invisible training weights. I was not only working on something I enjoyed, but I had the capacity to work on it for 8-12 hours straight. I went through a self-imposed plan to get the A+, Network+, Security+, and OSCP certifications, all before I graduated.

A few months before where I am right now, 6 months before graduation, I realized coding wasn't so bad. Python and bash scripting was easy to understand. I had the confidence to go deeper. Right now, I'm interested in Pentesting, Vulnerability Research, and CNO Development. This blog is a place for me to share my past and future experiences with you guys. I might share blogs on CTF's, Coding, Reversing, Research, or even just life. Thank you for joining me.
