I am a security researcher with a B.S. in Cyber Security. My professional interests include penetration testing, vulnerability research, and CNO development. I have earned my OSCP in addition to the Security+, Network+, and A+ certifications. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching anime, taking walks, and practicing martial arts.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have been dedicated to continuous learning and self-improvement. I believe that each failure is an opportunity for growth and that the wise incorporate lessons from their experiences in a way that the foolish do not. This philosophy has guided me as I have pursued my interests in the field of cybersecurity and has helped me to overcome personal challenges such as ADHD, which I was diagnosed with halfway through college.

I am currently studying x86-64 assembly and am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in the field. I hope to use this blog as a platform to share my experiences and insights with others who are interested in cybersecurity. Thank you for joining me on this journey.
