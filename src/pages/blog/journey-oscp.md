## Summary

It's been an incredible journey.

Initially I had meager goals. I just wanted to get my Security+ before I graduated. Once I had that, I set my eyes on the OSCP. After months of hard work, I got that too. Today, I'm satisfied with my credentials. However, I haven't given up my pursuit of knowledge. Below is the plan that I started with. I created it near the beginning of 2021 and expanded it to what it is today. Although I didn't complete everything on the list due to time constraints, I'm happy to say I passed with 90/100 points. It didn't come easy. I spent 22 hours on the penetration test and 16 hours writing the report. All that in a span of 48 hours. In the moment, it definitely sucked. Caffeine and my desire for sleep were in a constant battle. But, less than 2 days later, I got my pass result. I'm very thankful that I got my results right before DEF CON 30.

I hope this summary and/or the following plan inspires you as well.
